# Source 2 Pancake FPS Starter Kit (PFSK)
**NOTICE**: The PFSK is a pre-release project that is not production ready at this time, and may require substantial modification before it may be considered production ready. The PFSK's features and content are not final and is subject to change at any time.

Contributions are welcome!

The Source 2 Pancake FPS Starter Kit is designed to be a shared addon base that any non-VR supporting addon for Half-Life: Alyx can use.

# Usage
1. Download the latest release from the releases page. You'll need a program like 7-Zip to open it.

2. Extract "hlvr" and "pancake_base" to your "steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\game\" folder. Make sure you overwrite any files that need to be overwritten.

3. That's it! Simply make an addon (or if you have an existing one, use that), and you can now use the PFSK!
